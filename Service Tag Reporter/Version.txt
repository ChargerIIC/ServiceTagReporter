Service Tag reporter is a software based utility that fetches warranty information from Dell's Warranty tracking servers.
Enter in the desired service tags into the left hand input window and click 'Query Tags' to get a list of products and thier 
associated warranties. If you need to find out the service tag of a remote workstation in your network enter the machine name 
or IP address next to the 'Find Tag' button. Click on the button and the service tag will be added to the input box.
